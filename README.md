# Test Device Management Platform

Assessment provided by S4-Digital. This project will be continued until all functionalities are completed.

## Summary

According to the assessment the following functionalities have been covered on

- ~~Main screen should have the list of devices (if they exist) and buttons to add/edit/remove test devices (test device has properties: model, os, current owner,
  notes)~~

- ~~When clicking add/edit/remove you are navigated to another screen to perform the action~~
- When a device is removed the 'quote of the day' is shown in a popup (from https://zenquotes.io/api/today or a similar api)

- Dont forget Unit Testing for your objectives!
  - **Reason:** Due to lack of time but will be implemented within this week.
